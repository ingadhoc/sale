======================
Point of Sale Event UX
======================

Prevents selling more event tickets than the event capacity from the Point of Sale.

On Odoo 19 the standard capacity guard misses the event capacity on the PoS flow, so an order can push an event past its ``seats_max`` with no error at all (the per ticket and per slot limits are enforced by the core). This module re-runs the capacity check on the registrations of the order when it is paid, raising a ``ValidationError`` on overbooking.

Note: the check runs at synchronization time, after the cashier took the money. In that case the order fails to sync and no ticket is issued.
