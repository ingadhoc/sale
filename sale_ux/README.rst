Sale UX
=======

Several Improvements to sales:

#. Make button print and send by email also available on done state on sale orders.
#. Make sale quotations menu only visible with technical features.
#. Make sale orders menu show all sale records (quotations, and confirmed ones).
#. Add a menu item on sales for 'sale lines' and improve views with more fields.
#. Make that, by default, links to sale orders shows "sale" data and not only "quoatation" data.
#. Make cancel button also visible on done state so that if "Never allow to modify a confirmed sale order" is enable, sale users can still cancel a sale order that has not been delivered or invoiced yet.
#. Add button to force "invoiced" only for admin with tec features.
#. Add tracking to payment term and pricelist on sale orders.
#. Add option to show SO reference field on tree view and on main section of form view.
