Sale UX
=======

Several Improvements to sales:

#. Make sale quotations menu not visible.
#. Hide sale invoicing menu (you can already filter on sales orders menu)
#. Add filters in the sale order view
#. Make sale orders menu show all sale records (quotations, and confirmed ones). Make that, by default, links to sale orders shows "sale" data and not only "quotation" data.
#. Add option in settings to show "Customer Reference" field on Sale Order tree view and in the main section of the form view.
#. Add a menu item on Orders for "Sale Order Lines" and improve views with more fields.
#. Allow cancel sales orders in locked state and unlock it after cancelling
#. Fix in button "Create invoice" in sale orders, to create a refund invoice if the sale order amount it's zero and the line's quantities are negative (because of a return).
#. Block cancellation of a sale order if there is a related invoice in a state different from "draft" or "cancel".
#. Customer Preview" button in sale orders, opens the online quotation in a new tab.
#. We rename the field price_subtotal and price_total to "Subtotal" and "Total" respectively in sale.order.form
#. Add option in Sales settings to update prices automatically.
#. Add selection field to force "Invoiced" status of a sale order, available only for admin with tec features.
#. Add options in settings to allow any user as salesman (portal or internal)
#. Add a setting to create an analytic account without company when confirming the sale (requires enabling analytics accounting)
#. Add the field "Internal Notes" in the sales order form and the setting to allow propagating the "Internal Notes / terms & conditions" to invoices / pickings.
#. Automatically refresh taxes when changing fiscal position
#. Do not use fiscal positions on prices. By default, when using fiscal position and taxes included on the price on sale orders, the price used on the sale line will be the price without the tax being replaced. We remove that functionality. There are some issues where this is already discussed in odoo standard. For eg. https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/66875
#. Makes the "update prices" button visible.
#. Add setting to show product image on quotation report
#. Add a setting for automatic cancellation of quotations
