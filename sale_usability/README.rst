Sale Usability Improvements
===========================

Several Improvements to sales:
#. Add button "Re-Open" on sale orders to came back from "Done" to "Sale Order" state, only available to sale manager
#. Make button print and send by email also available on done state on sale orders
#. Make sale quotations menu only visible with technical features
#. Make sale orders menu show all sale records (quotations, and confirmed ones)
#. Add a menu item on sales for 'sale lines' and improove views with more fields.
#. Make that, by default, links to sale orders shows "sale" data and not only "quoatation" data
#. Make cancel button also visible on done state so that if "Never allow to modify a confirmed sale order" is enable, sale users can still cancel a sale order that has not been delivered or invoiced yet
#. Add button to force "invoiced" only for admin with tec features
#. Add currency field on SO lines to display monetary widget with currency symbol (TODO checkl and remove on v10)
#. Add tracking to payment term and pricelist on sale orders
#. Add option to show SO reference field on tree view and on main section of form view
