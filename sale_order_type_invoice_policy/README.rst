Sale Order Type Invoice Policy
==============================

Add to sale order type invoice policy field with possible values:
#. Defined by Product: default odoo behaviour, invoice qty will be computed considering product configuration
#. Ordered quantities: overwrites product behaviour so that all lines are considered as "ordered quantities" no matter product configuration, once order is confirmed all products should be invoiced.
#. Before Delivery: similar than ordered quantities but it requires a pay invoice for every line before order confirmation
