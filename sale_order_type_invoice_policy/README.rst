================================
Sale Order Type Invoicing Policy
================================

Add to sale order type invoice policy field with possible values:

* Defined by Product: default odoo behaviour, invoice qty will be computed considering product configuration.
* Ordered quantities: overwrites product behaviour so that all lines are considered as "ordered quantities" no matter product configuration, once order is confirmed all products should be invoiced.
* Before Delivery: similar than ordered quantities but it requires a pay invoice for every line before order confirmation.
* This module is also integrated with sale_usability_return_invoicing so that returns for "Before Delivery" or "Ordered quantities" can be returned.
